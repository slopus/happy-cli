  Vuln 1: Unrestricted File System Access via RPC Handlers - src/modules/common/registerCommonHandlers.ts:186-391

  - Severity: High
  - Category: unauthorized_file_access
  - Description: The RPC handlers readFile, writeFile, listDirectory, and getDirectoryTree provide complete file system access to authenticated
  remote clients with no path restrictions or sandboxing. These handlers accept absolute paths and can read/write any file that the process has
  permissions to access, including sensitive credentials and private repository contents.
  - Exploit Scenario: An attacker who obtains the user's authentication credentials from ~/.handy/access.key (via malware, backup theft, or social
  engineering) can authenticate to the Happy server and invoke RPCs to: (1) Read SSH keys: {sessionId}:readFile with {path: 
  "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"}, (2) Exfiltrate entire private repositories by calling getDirectoryTree followed by multiple readFile calls, (3) Write
  malicious code to startup files: writeFile with {path: "/home/user/.bashrc", content: malicious_payload}, (4) Access AWS credentials, npm tokens,
   git configs, and other sensitive files stored in the user's home directory.
  - Recommendation: (1) Implement strict path sandboxing to restrict all file operations to the session's working directory (session.metadata.path)
   and its subdirectories. Reject any paths that resolve outside this boundary using path.resolve() validation. (2) Add a blacklist for sensitive
  paths (.ssh/, .aws/, .env, credentials, id_rsa, .npmrc, .gitconfig) that are blocked even within the working directory. (3) Implement rate
  limiting (max 10 file reads/minute, 5 writes/minute). (4) Require explicit user approval via the mobile app for file operations outside
  git-tracked files. (5) Add comprehensive audit logging for all file operations with alerting on sensitive file access patterns.
