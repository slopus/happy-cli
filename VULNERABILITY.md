  Vuln 2: Expo Push Tokens Logged in Plaintext - src/api/pushNotifications.ts:43-44,143,153

  - Severity: Medium
  - Category: credential_exposure
  - Description: Expo push notification device tokens (ExponentPushToken[...]) are logged in plaintext to local debug log files stored in
  ~/.happy/logs/ or ~/.happy-dev/logs/. These tokens are security-sensitive credentials that enable sending push notifications to user devices via
  the Expo Push API. Log files are created with standard file permissions, making them readable by other processes running as the same user.
  - Exploit Scenario: An attacker who gains user-level access to the machine (via malware, compromised package, or local privilege escalation) can
  read the log files and extract push tokens. With these tokens, the attacker can: (1) Send unauthorized push notifications impersonating the
  legitimate Happy app, (2) Craft phishing notifications to trick users into revealing credentials or taking harmful actions, (3) Track and
  identify specific user devices, (4) Spam users with unwanted notifications causing denial-of-service. The code includes a comment "FULL TOKENS
  FOR TESTING" suggesting this verbose logging may not have been intended for production.
  - Recommendation: (1) Remove or redact push token logging in pushNotifications.ts lines 43-44, 143, and 153. If logging is necessary for
  debugging, show only the last 4 characters (e.g., ExponentPushToken[...xyz123]). (2) Set log file permissions to 600 (user-only readable) when
  creating log files. (3) Implement log rotation with automatic purging of old logs containing sensitive data. (4) Add a code review process to
  catch accidental logging of credentials before merging to production.
